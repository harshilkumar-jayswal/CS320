### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by following industry standard coding practices. Conduct thorough testing, and with automated testing can also help you save time and increase accuracy. I would use secure coding practices such as secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, input validation, error handling, and cryptography. I can implement access controls by enforcing user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by gathering user requirements from the users. This involves conducting interviews, surveys, focus groups, or other methods to get a clear understanding of what the users need and expect from the program. Then analyze them so that will help me prioritize the requirements and create a roadmap for development.

### How do I approach designing software?
I made sure to explain my coding approach in the documentation. I explained my testing coverage and testing functionality in detail. I was able to explain my bias and how can I remove the gaps. I explained that I employed a cauatious mindset while dealing with bugs. I would follow these principals whilke designing any software in the future.
